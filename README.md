# A Study of Baseball Attendance: the Effects of Winning and Top-End Player Acquisitions
This is a statistical examination of one of the factors most critical to measuring a major league team’s success:
attendance, the most direct driver of a team’s revenue. In my analysis, I sought to answer several questions.
The first two were fairly obvious:

1. What is the relationship between team wins and attendance?
2. How does winning a league pennant or World Series relate to attendance?

The deeper, more intriguing questions I wanted to address were related to payroll and high-end player
acquisitions:

3. Is there a relationship between payroll and attendance?
4. How does a top-end player acquisition relate to attendance?

I chose to look at the years 2000-2017, as that 18-year period would allow for an adequate number of data
points (540), while covering the period containing all modern mega-contracts. I should note that this is an
observational study, so it cannot make any causal conclusions.
